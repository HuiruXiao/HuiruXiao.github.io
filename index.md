## About me

I am Huiru Xiao, a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). My research topics are machine learning and natural language processing. I am interested in geometric learning for knowledge graph representations.

I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Mathematics and Physics, Tsinghua University in 2016.
