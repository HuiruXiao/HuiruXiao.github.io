## About me

I am Huiru Xiao, a lecturer in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

I obtaind my Ph.D. degree in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022, supervised by [Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). My research topics are machine learning and natural language processing. I am interested in geometric learning for knowledge graph representations. My thesis title is Learning with Hierarchical Data.

I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Mathematics and Physics, Tsinghua University in 2016.
